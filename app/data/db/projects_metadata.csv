Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) might restore intestinal microbial balance. The study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of FMT in IBS patients, as well as also positive predictors for FMT.&#10;METHODS: &#10;This was a single-arm, open-label study. Eligible patients were diagnosed based on Rome III Diagnostic Criteria. Fecal materials were administered to the patient via colonoscopy. The primary end point was a change in the Bristol stool form scale at 4 weeks after FMT. Recovery to types 3-4 was considered a clinical response. The secondary end point was a change in intestinal microbiota and psychological status using the Hamilton Rating Scale.&#10;RESULTS: &#10;Ten patients were enrolled. Six patients achieved a clinical response. The diversity of patients 4 weeks after FMT increased significantly compared with patients before FMT, and that of responding patients was significantly higher than non-responder patients. The abundance of Bifidobacterium in effective donors was significantly higher than in ineffective donors and patients. Psychological status of all patients was significantly improved after FMT.&#10;CONCLUSIONS: &#10;FMT for patients with IBS is safe, and relatively effective. Bifidobacterium-rich fecal donor may be a positive predictor for successful FMT. Key Summary: (1) Dysbiosis is associated with various gastrointestinal disorders including IBS. (2) FMT has potential to restore intestinal microbial balance. (3) We showed that FMT improved stool form and psychological status of IBS patients.

For each fecal sample, approximately 33 swabs were collected from each NICU room from 6 specified areas: sink, feeding and intubation tubing, hands of healthcare providers and parents, general surfaces, and nurse station electronics (keyboard, mouse, and cell phone). Swabs were processed using a recently developed 'expectation maximization iterative reconstruction of genes from the environment' (EMIRGE) amplicon pipeline in which full-length 16S rRNA amplicons were sheared and sequenced using an Illumina platform, and short reads reassembled into full-length genes. Over 24,000 full-length 16S rRNA sequences were produced, generating an average of approximately 12,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (clustered at 97% nucleotide identity) per room-infant pair.

We investigated the impact of HIV-1 infection on the intestinal microbiome and its association with mucosal T-cell and dendritic cell (DC) frequency and activation, as well as with levels of systemic T-cell activation, inflammation, and microbial translocation. Bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing was performed on colon biopsies and fecal samples from subjects with chronic, untreated HIV-1 infection and uninfected control subjects. Colon biopsies of HIV-1-infected subjects had increased abundances of Proteobacteria and decreased abundances of Firmicutes compared with uninfected donors. Furthermore at the genus level, a significant increase in Prevotella and decrease in Bacteroides was observed in HIV-1-infected subjects, indicating a disruption in the Bacteroidetes bacterial community structure. This HIV-1-associated increase in Prevotella abundance was associated with increased numbers of activated colonic T cells and myeloid DCs. Principal coordinates analysis demonstrated an HIV-1-related change in the microbiome that was associated with increased mucosal cellular immune activation, microbial translocation, and blood T-cell activation. These observations suggest that an important relationship exists between altered mucosal bacterial communities and intestinal inflammation during chronic HIV-1 infection.",2021-01-21 12:15:08 UTC,2021-01-21 12:15:08 UTC

We identified an additional 171 oligotypes that exhibited differential abundance patterns among all the host species. Blautia oligotypes in the human population obtained from sewage and fecal samples displayed remarkable continuity. Oligotypes from only 10 Brazilian human fecal samples collected from individuals in a rural village encompassed 97% of all Blautia oligotypes found in a Brazilian sewage sample from a city of three million people. Further, 75% of the oligotypes in Brazilian human fecal samples matched those in US sewage samples, implying that a universal set of Blautia strains may be shared among culturally and geographically distinct human populations.

Here we report that high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed stable engraftment of gut microbiota following FMT using frozen fecal bacteria from a healthy donor. Similar bacterial taxa were found in post-transplantation samples obtained from the recipients and donor samples, but the relative abundance varied considerably between patients and time points. Post FMT samples from patients showed an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, representing 75-80% of the total sequence reads. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were less abundant (< 5%) than that found in patients prior to FMT. Post FMT samples from two patients were very similar to donor samples, with the Bacteroidetes phylum represented by a great abundance of members of the families Bacteroidaceae, Rikenellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, and were largely comprised of Bacteroides, Alistipes and Parabacteroides genera. Members of the phylum Firmicutes were represented by Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae and unclassified Clostridiales and members of the Firmicutes. One patient subsequently received antibiotics for an unrelated infection, resulting in an increase in the number of intestinal Proteobacteria, primarily Enterobacteriaceae.

Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified and sequenced. Analysis allowed for taxonomic identification, and quantitative PCR was used to quantify the bacterial load within samples.&#10;RESULTS: &#10;NEC samples generally contained an increased total burden of bacteria. NEC and non-NEC sample sets were both marked by high inter-individual variability and an abundance of opportunistic pathogens. There was no statistically significant distinction between the composition of NEC and non-NEC microbial communities. K-means clustering enabled us to identify several stable clusters, including clusters of NEC and midgut volvulus samples enriched with Clostridium and Bacteroides. Another cluster containing both NEC and non-NEC samples was marked by an abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and decreased diversity among NEC samples.&#10;CONCLUSIONS: &#10;The results indicate that NEC is a disease without a uniform pattern of microbial colonization, but that NEC is associated with an abundance of strict anaerobes and a decrease in community diversity",2021-01-21 12:15:08 UTC,2021-01-21 12:15:08 UTC

In Phase III, a focus was placed on six of the 18 body sites: Stool (gut), Buccal mucosa (oral), Supragingival plaque (oral), Tongue dorsum (oral), Anterior nares (nasal), Posterior fornix (vaginal) and the goal was to further capture as many of the longitudinal samples (second and third visits by the same individual) as possible.

However, there has been no information on the gut metagenome configuration in hunter-gatherer populations, posing a gap in our knowledge of gut microbiota (GM)-host mutualism arising from a lifestyle that describes over 90% of human evolutionary history. Here, we present the first metagenomic analysis of GM from Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, showing a unique enrichment in metabolic pathways that align with the dietary and environmental factors characteristic of their foraging lifestyle. We found that the Hadza GM is adapted for broad spectrum carbohydrate metabolism, reflecting the complex polysaccharides in their diet. Furthermore, the Hadza GM is equipped for branched-chain amino acid degradation and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Resistome functionality demonstrates the existence of antibiotic resistance genes in a population with little to no antibiotic exposure, indicating the ubiquitous presence of environmentally derived resistances. Our results demonstrate how the functional specificity of the GM correlates with environment and lifestyle, and how complexity from the exogenous environment is matched by endogenous homeostasis. The Hadza gut metagenome structure allows to appreciate the co-adaptive functional role of the GM in complementing the human physiology, providing a better understanding of the versatility of human life and subsistence",2021-01-21 12:15:08 UTC,2021-01-21 12:15:08 UTC

The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infants? gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota. In addition to AR genes relevant to specific antibiotics likely providing a protective function, we show that all antibiotic treatments also result in widespread collateral microbiome impact through enrichment  of AR genes with no known direct activity against the specific antibiotic treatment.",2021-01-21 12:15:08 UTC,2021-01-21 12:15:08 UTC

Defining the disturbances of the microbial composition and community structure after ICR and their link with early disease recurrence is crucial. Design Microbiota composition (fingerprinting and 16S rDNA sequencing) and community structure (correlation networks of bacterial species) were assessed from ileal mucosa sampled in 20 patients undergoing ICR and 6 months later during endoscopy from above (neoterminal ileum) and below (subanastomotic colon) the surgical anastomosis. Results ICR had a dramatic effect on gut microbial ecosystem. At surgery, CD mucosa harboured a dysbiotic microbiota with high proportions of _±/_² Proteobacteria and Bacilli. Six months later, half of the patients had recurrent lesions at ileocolonoscopy and presented higher numbers of Lachnospiraceae. Recurrence of endoscopic lesions was associated with enrichment in Enterococcus durans while patients in remission had increased proportions of Dorea longicatena and Bacteroides plebeius. Structural differences were striking between recurrence and remission microbiota; while the microbiota of patients with CD recurrence exhibited a loose community structure, the microbiota of patients in remission displayed communities that were robustly correlated to each other. Microbiota colonising the neoterminal ileum and subanastomotic colon 6 months after ICR only differed in patients with recurrence. Conclusions ICR modifies the gut microbiome. Remission after 6 months was associated with homogenous bacterial distribution around the anastomosis. Community structure and bacterial networks highlight target species, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Ruminococcus gnavus, which may allow precise modulations of the overall microbial ecosystem towards remission pattern",2021-01-21 12:15:08 UTC,2021-01-21 12:15:08 UTC

Obesity has suffered of a dramatic increase over the last decades especially in childhood. In recent years, several experimental and clinical studies have provided the evidences of the involvement of gut microbiota in obesity. Particularly, gut bacteria has shown to play a critical role in the regulation of host energy metabolism and body mass . The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of the gut microbiota in obese adolescents and adults compared to age matched healthy volunteers to identify age-related microbiota profiles correlated with obesity.\nMethods. A group of 25 adolescent and 20 adult obese patients were analyzed for gut microbiota composition by 16S rRNA targeted metagenomics and compared to 12 adolescents and 12 adult normal weight healthy volunteers (control group). The ?- and ?-diversity was evaluated, and univariate, multivariate and correlation analysis were performed on bacterial taxa profiles.\n\nResults. By ?- and ?-diversity analysis showed ecological dissimilarity among the 4 study groups. At phylum level, comparison between obese versus normal weight adolescents revealed differences in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes abundances, while, comparing adolescent versus adult obese, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes proportions resulted different.\n\nConclusions. The present study revealed unique features of gut microbiome in ecological diversity, composition and OTUs correlation patterns in obese adolescent, in comparison to normal weight healthy adolescents, but also in obese and normal weight healthy adults. The assessment of possible biomarkers in microbiota profiling could lead in developing tailored-obesity treatments as new probiotic drugs.

The gut microbial population is essential for metabolizing indigestible polysaccharides and in the absorption of short-chain fatty acids produced by bacterial fermentation and also plays a key role in the regulation of intestinal transit, thereby affecting the amount of energy absorbed from the diet. The gut microbiota consists of two separate microbial populations, the lumen-associated microbiota (LAM) and the mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM): a shift in these microbial populations may have more pronounced effects on host immunity and gut homeostasis.\nLAM and MAM microbial populations can show profound differences in their composition, since fecal microbiota is predominantly comprised of those microbes resident in the lumen (e.g. free-living or associated with undigested food matrices), both obscuring and not accurately reflecting the composition of the mucosal-associated microbiota, and fluctuating with changes in diet and luminal content. On the other hand, the mucosa-associated microbiota is believed to be relatively stable in individuals over the course of a lifetime. Stability is achieved, in part, through the ability of these microbes to attach to the mucosa and to establish a niche through biofilm formation and creation of selection pressures that prevent expansion of other microbial communities. From their intimate and stable association with the host, mucosa-associated microbes are likely to have important influences on host physiology in health and the development of disease.\n\nFor the present study, 40 subjects, of whom 20 obese (BMI >30) and 20 controls (BMI <25) (10 males and 10 females per group) was recruited.\n\nThe aims of this study were i) to compare mucosa-associated microbiota, by means of sigmoid brush during colonoscopy, with fecal microbiota using high throughout next generation sequencing (NGS) and ii) to evaluate possible host factors that could influence the microbial biodiversity in the two niches",2021-01-21 12:15:09 UTC,2021-01-21 12:15:09 UTC

The relative abundances showed a decrease of unclassified Lactobacillales and Xanthomonadales and an increase of Pasteurellales. After PPI therapy there was a significant increase of ?- and ?-diversity.

Though the relationship between intestinal dysbiosis and CDI is well-known, it is unclear whether different forms of dysbiosis may potentially affect the course of CDI. How this is further influenced by difficile-directed antibiotics is virtually uninvestigated. In this study, diarrheal stool samples were collected from 20 hospitalized patients, half of whom were confirmed to have CDI. Analyzing tissue ex vivo and in duplicate, CDI and non-CDI fecal samples (n=176) were either antibiotic untreated or were treated with metronidazole, vancomycin or fidaxomicin, the three most common CDI therapies. Evaluation of the microbial community composition, interactions, and predicted metabolic functions was assessed using 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequencing, bipartite network analysis and PICRUSt. Our results demonstrate that while all difficile-directed antibiotics were associated with similar reductions in alpha diversity, beta-diversity significantly differed based on the particular antibiotic, with differentiating relative abundances of bacterial and fungal assemblages. With the exception of fidaxomicin, each antibiotic was associated with the emergence of potentially pathogenic fungal OTUs, with predicted bacterial functions enriched for xenobiotic metabolism which could perpetuate the dysbiosis driving CDI. Toxin- independent mechanisms of colitis related to the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria and fungi were also noted.

The current hypothesis is that these diseases are due to an overly aggressive immune response to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria. Studies to date on IBD have suggested that the disorder may be caused by a combination of bacteria and host susceptibility; however the etiologies of these diseases remain an enigma. In this application, we propose to develop and demonstrate the ability to profile Crohnâ__s disease at an unprecedented molecular level by elucidation of specific biomarkers (bacterial strains, genes, or proteins) that correlate to disease symptoms. To achieve this goal, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach based on metagenomic and metaproteomic molecular tools to elucidate the composition of the commensal microbiota in monozygotic twins that are either healthy or exhibit Crohnâ__s disease (for concordant, both are diseased; for discordant, one is healthy and one is diseased). The central hypotheses of this proposal are (1) that specific members and/or functional activities of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota differ in patients with Crohnâ__s disease as compared to healthy individuals, and (2) that it will be possible to elucidate microbial signatures which correlate with the occurrence and progression of this disease by integration of data obtained from 16S rRNA-based molecular fingerprinting, metagenomics, and metaproteomics approaches. To address these hypotheses, three specific aims are proposed: 1) Obtain data on community gene content (metagenome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohnâ__s Disease to assess potential differences in the metabolic capabilities of the gut microbiota associated with CD, 2) Obtain data on community protein content (metaproteome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohnâ__s Disease to assess the state of expressed proteins associated with CD, 3) Apply various statistical clustering and classification methods to correlate/associate microbial community composition, gene and protein content with patient metadata, including metabolite profiles and clinical phenotype. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to identify novel biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostics of CD and to eventually identify drug targets (i.e. bacterial strains) for cure or suppression of disease symptoms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to unravel the contribution of the bacteria that normally inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract to Crohnâ__s disease by using a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in the structure and function of gut microbial communities in three sets of patient cohorts who have Crohnâ__s disease. These results will be compared with those obtained from the study of healthy individuals and have the potential to identify new biomarkers of disease severity, location, and progression.",2021-01-21 12:15:09 UTC,2021-01-21 12:15:09 UTC

We performed a 2.5-year case study of the assembly of the human infant gut microbiome to relate life events to microbiome composition and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient. In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ~500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present prior to the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of which are characteristic of the adult microbiome. This study revealed that seemingly chaotic shifts in the microbiome could be attributed to life events.",2021-01-21 12:15:09 UTC,2021-01-21 12:15:09 UTC
